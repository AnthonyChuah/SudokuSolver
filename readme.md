This program solves sudoku problems. The problem should be written into the puzzle.dat file, with 0s in every blank cell.

Note: it cannot solve "hard" Sudoku problems in which there are bottlenecks where no particular blank cell has a unique possible value but a set of 2, 3, ... etc. cells share the same possibles and can thus eliminate others in the same row/col/square as them.

Note: it turns out that my university wants to assign this as homework, so I must add the feature for solving "hard" problems. Feature coming soon!

Note: also because it is a course project, I have removed the code. I will put it up again once the deadline for the course project is over.
